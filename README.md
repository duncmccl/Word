# Word
Excises using hash maps and reading files. 

Program reads in a text file "text.txt".

Input text is scrubbed into lowercase only alphabet letters only.

A nested hashmap is built using the hash of the words, then the hash of the word position [row, col]

Resulting hash map can then be quearied to find every occurence of any word.

Any questions can be emailed to me: duncmccl@udel.edu

# Word
Excises using hash maps and reading files. 

Program reads in a text file "text.txt".

Input text is scrubbed into lowercase only alphabet letters only.

A nested hashmap is built using the hash of the words, then the hash of the word's index.

Resulting hash map can then be queried to find every occurence of any word.

Any questions can be emailed to me: duncmccl@udel.edu
